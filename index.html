        </summary>
        <p>
            In one project, we faced performance issues with a web application due to inefficient database queries. I analyzed the query execution plans, identified bottlenecks, and optimized the queries. Additionally, I implemented database indexing, which improved the application's performance by 40%. This experience taught me the importance of detailed analysis and optimization in software development.
